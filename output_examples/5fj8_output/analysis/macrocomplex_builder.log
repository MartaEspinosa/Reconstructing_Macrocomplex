INFO:This program is analyzing 45 from 45 files.

INFO:The naming structure and the chains in the following structure file don't coincide:
INFO:5fj8_A_B-2
INFO:The files to analise contain interactions with nucleic acids. This program do not analise those situations. Further versions will do so.

INFO:
Stoichiometry was not provided. The program will use 1 for each chain as default value.

INFO:The files provided contain Protein-Protein Interactions.
